                <h3>Solid partnership with major car
                    manufacturers for original equipment supply
                </h3>
                <hr>


                <p>Pirelli’s product portfolio is developed in partnership with the most demanding and prestigious manufacturers.
                    These include Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, Porsche, Bentley, Aston Martin, Rolls-Royce,
                    Pagani and McLaren, as well as Premium car manufacturers such as Audi, Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Tesla and Volvo.</p>

                <p>Partnerships with manufacturers are fundamental to the Pirelli business model because they allow Pirelli to gain broad visibility of
                    the technological innovations happening in the sector and keep up with consumer needs, which can then be incorporated into its products before they are offered for sale.
                    This helps Pirelli to plan its medium and long term investments, particularly in research and development and production.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, car manufacturers benefit from the joint development process by achieving the perfect combination of a
                    tyre married to the dynamic characteristics and electronics of the car – the so-called “perfect fit”.</p>

                <p> An average of over 300 tyres were approved by car manufacturers each year in 2014-16.
                    In 2016 Pirelli had more than 1,900 High Value homologations – individual tyre approvals from leading car manufacturers.</p>

                <hr>


                <p>Pirelli’s presence in motorsports started in 1907 and the company has long believed that the experience it gains in this arena is beneficial to its research and development activities.</p>

                <p>The company currently supports some 460 car and motorcycle sport events, and this is driving innovation in design, modelling, materials, processes and testing.</p>

                <p>Meanwhile, car manufacturers benefit from the joint development process by achieving the perfect combination of a
                    tyre married to the dynamic characteristics and electronics of the car – the so-called “perfect fit”.</p>

                <p> One example comes from its role as exclusive tyre supplier to the Formula One™ World Championship. The data it compiles from its experiences on the track can be used for the development of road products.</p>
